The Arduino Drone Project was completed on 5/28/15 and uploaded on 6/28/15.

This code was used to hack a quadcopter in order to be able to control it from the computer. This was completed with two components:

-The Processing component, which provides the graphical user interface and the real time controlling capabilities.

-The Arduino component, which provides the actual functionality

There is a complicated hardware component required to make the code work.
